# 🧬 cancer-prediction-ml

A machine learning project focused on predicting cancer patient outcomes using real-world clinical data. It addresses two main tasks:

- **Classification**: Predicting whether a patient is alive or deceased (mortality status)
- **Regression**: Estimating survival time in months

## 📁 Project Structure

This project is divided into three Jupyter notebooks:

1. **Notebook 1** – Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis  
2. **Notebook 2** – Model training and evaluation (Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, KNN)  
3. **Notebook 3** – Soft Voting Ensemble for classification and Decision Trees for survival regression

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models

- Naïve Bayes  
- Logistic Regression  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Soft Voting Classifier (Naïve Bayes + Logistic Regression)  
- Decision Tree Regressors (Fully Grown and Pruned)

## 📊 Key Features

- Data preprocessing and transformation  
- Feature selection and train-test split with stratification  
- Classification metrics: accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC curve, AUC  
- Regression metrics: RMSE, MAE  
- Visualizations for model performance and decision boundaries  
- Comparison of individual and ensemble model performance
